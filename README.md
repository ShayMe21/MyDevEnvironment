## Applications
* Microsoft OneNote

* VS Code
* Postman
* Magnet
* Zoom
* Alfred
* Trello
* Tomighty
* Clocker



## Terminal
* [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/features.html): This is a must for any power user of terminal.
* [OhMyZsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) with [Powerline fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts): Nice aesthetics for the terminal and useful plugins.
* [htop](https://github.com/hishamhm/htop): replacement for `top`. Much prettier and more practical with useful key bindings:

  * **P**: Sort by CPU Usage

  * **M**: Sort by Memory Usage

  * **F4**: Filter by string

* [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat): Pretty much a replacement for `cat` (which prints contents of files) but with syntax highlighting, line numbers and more. I recommend adding it as alias to `cat` like so: 
  * `alias cat='bat'`
  
* [ncdu](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu): Get information about disk space.



## Browser and Extensions
* Vivaldi/Chrome: I use both but my primary browser has been [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com) lately because you get all features of Chrome + added customizations and features. 
* LastPass: Simply the best and most reliable password manager.
* Checker Plus for Gmail: 
* Checker Plus for Calender
* JWT Debugger
* Clipboard History Pro
* uBlock Origin
* Zoom scheduler


## Productivity Tips
* Desk setup + Room
  * Make sure your setup is as ergonomic as possible (See this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTL8EBBH69o)). Nothing destroys productivity more than a neck/back pain.
  * Take more frequent breaks by geting up from your chair. I follow the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) and it's helped me greatly stay more alert and less tired during work. You can use one of the many Apps or Browser extensions to remind you to take your break or get back to work. I personally use [Tomighty](http://www.tomighty.org) with the below settings:
